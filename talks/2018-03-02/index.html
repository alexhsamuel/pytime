# It's about time!
Alex Samuel
???
Hi!

I'm going to talk about times and dates in Python.

This talk is on GitHub, with an accompanying writeup that contains additional
details.  The writeup is still a work in progress, and I welcome your feedback.

---
# Goals
- Present general concerns in handling time and date.
- Survey the options in Python.
- Discuss features, performance.

???
I signed up to do this talk because there are a bewildering array of options
for working with times and dates in Python.  I work with some of them on a 
regular basis, but others I have used only occasionally or not at all.

In order to force myself to evaluate the choices currently out there,
I submitted to do this talk.

I'm warning you now, this will be the least sexy talk you attend today.  My goal
is to bore you with gory details of dealing with times, dates, and time zones.

I'll stick to civil time as is widely used in business, and won't go into leap
seconds, relativistic effects, or astronomical time systems.

Also this is not a tutorial!  My intent is to help you to choose the best tools
for your work.

I've been writing Python code for a long time.  In the past, I worked in
physics, where I wrote lots of Python data handling code.  Now I work in
finance, at Tudor Investment Corporation, where I write lots of Python data
handling code.

A lot of it involves times and dates, as you may imagine.

My GitHub is alexhsamuel.  There you will find lots of languishing, uncompleted
projects.  And this talk.

# Preliminaries
???
Let's start by discussing some basic concepts.

---
# Time
- Like space except just one dimension.
- Increases monotonically.
???
What's time?

Without getting too philosophical, time is kind of like space, except that it
has one coordinate instead of three.  Its value grows monotonically.  Basically
it's pretty simple.

In computer programs, we mainly want to record the exact instant of time at
which a particular event happened, for example,
- when a user performed an action, 
- or when a transaction occurred.

---
# Date
- Time is divided into days.
- A day is recurring span of (usually) 24 hours.
- Date specifies a day.
???
Humans of course have to go and complicate something as simple as this.

What we do is divide time into recurring spans of (usually) 24 hours, called
_days_, coinciding approximately with the Earth's rotation.

Traditionally, we specify time by first specifying a date, and then giving the
time of day relative to the beginning of that date (_midnight_).

We use a bizarre set of units: years, 12 months a year, 28 to 31 days a month,
23 to 25 hours a day, 60 minutes an hour, and 60 seconds a minute.

---
# Time zones
<img src="Time-Zone-Map.gif" style="width: 85%;">
???
To complicate things _even_ further, we don't event agree on when each day
starts.

Each government slices its territories into _time zones_.  Within each time
zone, we agree to set all clocks forward or backward compared to clocks in a
hypothetical reference time zone, which we call UTC.

Within a time zone, this offset from UTC may change during the year, due to
daylight savings time.

A government is free to change its mind about its time zones, and governments do
so from time to time.

---
# Time zone database
<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">Database</a> a.k.a. "Olson database".
- Linux, macOS: `/usr/share/zoneinfo`

Geographic names like "America/New_York".
???
Fortunately, the selfless souls at IANA maintain a database of time zones and
their historical, current, and projected offsets from UTC.

This is often called the "Olson database".

On most Linux systems and macOS, it's installed in a bunch of files under
`/usr/share/zoneinfo`; you can poke around there.  

On Windows, some comparable information is stuffed in a DLL.  I don't know
much about this.

In the database, a time zone is generally identified by a continent and city
name, like "America/New_York", where we are.  We happen to be UTC-5 hours in the
winter and UTC-4 hours when daylight savings time is in effect.

Note that UTC-5 is not the same as "America/New_York" or even U.S. Eastern time.
For example, the "America/Bogota" time zone is also UTC-5 and in fact since
Colombia currently doesn't do daylight savings, it stays there year around.

---
# Time formats

<pre style="font-size: 85%;">

<div class="center" style="border: 2px solid black; font-weight: 700; padding: 8px">2017-11-25T21:01:30+00:00</div>

???
There are countless variations on how to format times and dates as strings.

- with/without UTC offset
- dashes or slashes or other punctuation
- year first, month first, day first
- month names, abbreviated names
- day of the week
- and of course, other languages

For computers, there is a standard family of formats called ISO 8601, and a more
specific standard RFC 3339 for Internet protocols.  This highlighted string is
an example.

Sometimes you'll see a "Z" suffix instead of +00:00 to indicate UTC.

# Python representations
???
Now, on to Python.

I've found four general categoies of ways to represent times and dates in
Python.

1. using only built-in types
2. the standard library's `datetime` package
3. derivatives of the datetime library
4. types for collections of times and dates in datasets

I'll now go into each of these.

---
# Primitive types
- string times and dates: 
    - `"2017-11-25"` 
    - `"2017-11-25T16:01:30+00:00"`

- integer-encoded strings:
    - `20171125`

<br>
```py
date = 10000 * year + 100 * month + day    # ☹
```
???
A simple way to store a time or date is as a string.  You have a choice of
formats, as we've seen.

Another option, especially for dates, is to pack the year, month, date
components into an integer.

How many of you have written code like this at some point?

The chief benefit of these representations is that they work with all languages,
frameworks, storage systems, and file formats.  You can always store a string.

But, there are basically no time operations you can perform directly on these
representations directly.  You're on your own.

---
# Tick representations
Choose a starting time ("epoch") and a unit, and count ticks.
```py
# seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00
>>> time.time()
1519950320.1002948
```
???
Another representation that doesn't require specialized types you might call a
_tick representation_.  You choose a starting time, called the _epoch_, you
choose a unit of time, and just count ticks forward.

In UNIX, and Python, we traditionally use UTC midnight on Jan 1, 1970 as the
epoch, and count seconds.

This representation is closest to the physical reality of time.  It's simple.
Clear.  When one second elapses, this number increases by 1.

Python's simplest time API, `time.time()`, returns the time on system clock
as seconds since the epoch.

If it weren't for humans and their idiosyncrasies, we could stop right here and
this would be my last slide.

---
# [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)

`datetime`, `date`, `time`, `tzinfo`, and more.

A time (an instance of the `datetime` class) can be,
  - _naive_, without time zone
  - _aware_, with time zone 
???
The standard library datetime package solves many of our problems.

It provides a time type, called `datetime`, which stores times internally as
(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond) components.  

So, the time resolution is 1 µs.

There are two flavors of datetimes: _naive_ datetimes carry no time zones, while
_aware_ datetimes do.

The datetime package also provides date and time of day types.

These are all implemented as C extension types, and rather efficient.

---
class: middle
```py
>>> t = datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
>>> t
datetime(2018, 3, 2, 22, 58, 10, 711162, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
>>> t.year, t.month, t.day
(2018, 3, 2)
```
Formatting and parsing per C library `strftime()`.
```py
>>> t = datetime(2017, 11, 26, 17, 45, 37)
>>> print("It's now {:%H:%M}.".format(t))
It's now 17:45.
```
???
You can access its components as attributes, or extract the date or time of day
as separate objects.

Parsing and formatting use patterns similar to the C library's strftime and
strptime functions.  They participate nicely with Python's string formatting.
You can stuff the format pattern directly into the curly braces.

Dates are fundamentally different objects, with different operations they can
participate in.  You'll sometimes see dates represented as the time at midnight
on that date.  Python gives you a real date type.  Use it.

---
# Shortcomings of datatime
- `tzinfo` interface but time zone database
- limited convenience functions and utilities
- 1 µs resolution 
???
The datetime package has a number of limitations.

It provides time zones with fixed UTC offsets, but not the full database of
geographical and political time zones people expect.

Its API isn't always the most convenient, and it lacks many creature comforts
and useful utilities that people often need.

And, its 1 µs resolution is inadequate for some domains.

One approach to address these is to use additional third-party libraries with
datetime.

---
# datetime + [dateutil](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Implements `tzinfo` using the system time zone database.
- Also includes a copy of the time zone database.

```py
>>> tz = dateutil.tz.gettz("America/New_York")
```

- Convenient parsing.

```py
>>> dateutil.parser.parse("2017 Nov 1 9:15:00 UTC")
datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 1, 9, 15, 
    tzinfo=tzutc())
```
???
By default, `datetime` uses your system's time zone database, but it also
carries its own copy for use if needed.

dateutil also provides a convenient time parser, which can usually figure out
the format of a time string without being told.

---
# datetime + [pytz](http://pythonhosted.org/pytz/)
- Includes a recent copy of the time zone database.
- Implements `tzinfo`.

```py
>>> tz = pytz.timezone("America/New_York")
>>> tz.localize(datetime.now())
datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 26, 18, 1, 6, 620221,
  tzinfo=<DstTzInfo 'America/New_York' EST-1 day, 
          19:00:00 STD>)
```
???
pytz is a another third party time zone package, and carries the time zone
database.

With pytz, it's critical to use this localize method; you can't just stuff the
time zone object into the datetime's tz field yourself.  You will get the
wrong results!

---
# datetime + [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/)
An internationalization library with time and date support.
```py
>>> babel.dates.format_datetime(t, locale="zh")
'2017年11月26日 下午11:32:31'
```

It uses JODA-style format patterns.
```py
>>> babel.dates.format_date(d, "'The 'dd' of 'MMMM', 'yyyy")
'The 26 of November, 2017'
```
???
Babel is an internationalization package that handles dates and times.

Conveniently, you can pass in a locale for each formatting operation.

Some people prefer the JODA-style yyyy, MM, dd format strings to the
strftime-style %Y, %m, %d.

---
# datetime + [udatetime](https://github.com/freach/udatetime)

Accelerated versions of some functionality, particularly RFC 3339 formatting,
but doesn't support time zones properly.

Particularly fast for generating timestamp strings for logs, APIs.
```py
>>> udatetime.utcnow_to_string()
'2017-11-27T00:19:42.815547+00:00'
```
POSIX only; no Windows support.

---
# [humanize](https://github.com/jmoiron/humanize)
A small library to produce casual human-friendly representations.
```py
>>> t = datetime.now(); time.sleep(10); humanize.naturaltime(t)
'10 seconds ago'
>>> humanize.naturaldate(date(2018, 3, 1))
'yesterday'
```

---
class: middle
# datetime derivatives
???
On to derivatives of datetime.

There have been several attempts to improve datetime by wrapping it or extending
it.

---
<img src="delorean.png" style="float: right">
# [Delorean](http://delorean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Wraps `datetime.datetime`.
- Integrates pytz, Babel, humanize.
- A few convenience methods.

```py
>>> t = Delorean.now("America/New_York")
>>> t.truncate("month")
>>> print(t.format_datetime())
Nov 1, 2017, 12:00:00 AM
>>> print(t.humanize())
25 days ago
```
???
...

Notice that you can pass in time zones as strings, which is nice.

But: It provides no date or time classes.  And the API feels inconsistent.  For
example, it doesn't participate in Python's normal string formatting mechanism.

---
# [Arrow](http://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Wraps `datetime.datetime`
- aware times only.  <small>☺</small>
- Integrates `dateutil.tz`.

```py
>>> t = arrow.get("2017-11-26T20:00:00-05:00")
>>> t.to("Asia/Tokyo")
>>> t.format("ddd MMM DD, HH:mm:ssZZ")
'Sun Nov 26, 20:00:00-05:00'
```
???
...

As with Delorean, you can pass time zone names.

I find the formatting a bit cumbersome, but some prefer this.

But: Arrow also provides no date or time classes.

---
- Well-designed convenience methods.
```py
>>> arrow.get(1511743679)                   # epoch seconds
<Arrow [2017-11-27T00:47:59+00:00]>
>>> t.replace(minute=30, second=0)
<Arrow [2017-11-27T00:30:00+00:00]>
>>> t.shift(months=6)
<Arrow [2018-05-27T00:47:59+00:00]>
```
- Custom formatting and localization (50 languages).
```py
>>> t.floor("month").humanize(locale="hi")
'एक माह  पहले'                               # "one month ago"
```
???
You can convert epoch seconds and other values easily into Arrow instances.

There are convenient methods to change fields, shift forward or backward
by each time unit, to round up or down by a time unit, and so forth.

It has a completely custom formatting implementation, with localization to 
50 languages and also "humanize" formats.

---
# [Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/)
An ambitious extension of datetime.
- Extends `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `tzinfo`.
- Rich, well-designed API.
- Aware times only.  <small>☺</small>
- Time zone data from [`pytzdata`](https://github.com/sdispater/pytzdata), but
  reads database directly.
???
An ambitious extension of datetime.

It's the only extension package that provides a date type and a time of day type
in addition to time.  

Aware times only!

Because it subclasses rather than wraps datetime types, its instances are
drop-in replacements.

The API is quite extensive.

---

- Smart parsing.

```py
>>> pendulum.parse("Nov 26, 2017 20:00:00", 
...     tz="America/New_York")
<Pendulum [2017-11-26T20:00:00-05:00]>
```
- Lots of formatting options.

```py
>>> t = pendulum.now("Asia/Istanbul")
>>> t.date().format("%A %d %B %Y", locale="tr")
'Pazartesi 27 Kasım 2017'
>>> t.date().to_date_string()
'2017-11-27'
```
???
Smart parsing.

Lots of formatting options, with about 50 languages supported.

---
class: middle

- Lots of convenience methods.

```py
>>> t.start_of("century")
<Pendulum [2001-01-01T00:00:00+02:00]>
>>> t.date().previous(pendulum.WEDNESDAY)
<Date [2017-11-22]>
>>> t.time().add(hours=4)
<Time [08:27:21.750466]>
```

# Time and date in datasets
???
This is PyDATA!  One time value is not enough.  We want to store large
datasets with times and dates in them.

So let's consider the options.

---
# [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.datetime.html)
datetime64 &mdash; int64 ticks since epoch.

- Very efficient storage.
- Very limited selection of operations.
- Naive times (datetime64[ns]) and dates (datetime64[D]).

```py
>>> np.array(times, dtype="datetime64[ns]")
array(['2017-11-26T20:48:38.911016000', 
       '2017-11-26T20:48:39.807050000',
       '2017-11-26T20:48:42.518963000'], 
      dtype='datetime64[ns]')
```
???
If you use NumPy, you may be aware of the datetime64 dtype.

This is a tick representation: internally, it stores an int64 containing the
number of time units since the epoch.  

There are many time units: days, seconds, ms, µs, ns.  There are even actually
ps and fs as well, but the range of these is so small that they're virtually
useless.

This representation is commonly used in technical applications, particularly
with ns.  So it's a natural fit for NumPy and easy to convert.

Storage is extremely efficient: in an array, each value takes up 8 bytes.

BUT: other than type conversion and comparison, there are basically no
operations available.  NumPy can store your times and dates but can't do too
much with them.

NumPy's times are all effectively naive; it has no notion of time zones.

# [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html)

Pandas is backed by NumPy arrays, but works hard to fill in all the missing
features.
???
What about Pandas?  It's backed by NumPy arrays and uses datetime64, but
works hard to fill in missing features.

---
class: middle
Pandas uses datetime64[ns] for time indexes and series, but adds localization.
```py
>>> times = [ datetime.now() for _ in range(3) ]
>>> idx = pd.DatetimeIndex(times).tz_localize("America/New_York")
>>> idx
DatetimeIndex(['2017-11-26 21:22:15.235690-05:00',
               '2017-11-26 21:22:15.235696-05:00',
               '2017-11-26 21:22:15.235697-05:00'],
          dtype='datetime64[ns, America/New_York]', 
          freq=None)
```
???
Pandas uses datetime64[ns] for time indexes and series, but adds localization.

In this example, we use the tz_localize method to localize all the values in the
datetime index.  You can see that Pandas has stuffed the time zone into the
dtype, even though NumPy itself doesn't support time zone-aware dtypes.

---
Datetime indexes have time-specific methods.
```py
>>> idx.tz_convert("Asia/Tokyo")
DatetimeIndex(['2017-11-27 11:25:10.898552+09:00',
               '2017-11-27 11:25:10.898557+09:00',
               '2017-11-27 11:25:10.898558+09:00'],
          dtype='datetime64[ns, Asia/Tokyo]', 
          freq=None)
```

For time-valued series, values are on the `dt` proxy attribute.
```py
>>> series = series.dt.tz_convert("Europe/London")
>>> series.dt.hour.values
array([17, 17, 17])
```
???
Datetime indexes have time-specific attributes and methods, such as `tz_convert`
and year, month, day, hour, minute, second fields.

For series whose values are times, these attributes and methods are organized
within a magic `dt` proxy attribute.


---
class: middle
Also, Pandas provides a `Timestamp` class for single time values.
```py
>>> ser[0]
Timestamp('2017-11-26 17:25:10.898552+0000', 
          tz='Europe/London')
```

This is an enhanced subclass of `datetime`:
- augments resolution to 1 ns
- adds a few convenience methods
???
Also, Pandas provides a `Timestamp` class for single time values.  If you 
extract a single value from a datetime index or series, Pandas wraps it for
you in this class.

The `Timestamp` class is a subclass of datetime, but augments its resolution 
to 1 ns and also adds the same convenience methods that the datetime index
and series provide.

This provides some nice features, though not as many or well-designed methods as
Pendulum.

# Performance

The standard library datetime package performs surprisingly well for all
operations.

In comparison,

- Operations that udatetime provides are same or faster.

- NumPy `datetime64` and Pandas `Timestamp` operations are similar or slower.

- Delorean, Arrow, and Pendulum are a lot slower, often 20&times; or more.

- Delorean is generally the slowest.

- pytz is somewhat faster than dateutil for time zone operations.

???
Those are major choices available to you.  

We've discussed the features; now a quick word on performance.

I don't have time to present detailed benchmarks, but here are some general
results.

...

Delorean is the slowest of the bunch.

The benchmark results and explanation are in the GitHub repo.

# Roundup
???
Now for the roundup.

I'll also note that the GitHub repo also has a feature matrix which summarizes
many of the facts above.

---
class: advice, middle
For ease of use, Pendulum is a good choice.
???
...

Pendulum has tons of features, a solid API, and clear documentation.  In
contrast to Delorean and Arrow: it provides additional types for dates, time of
day, intervals, _etc._; and its types subclass the corresponding datetime types,
so they are drop-in compatible.

Arrow is a solid second choice, if you don't care about date
handling&mdash;since it does not provide a date type.  

Delorean lags in features and performance.

---
class: advice, middle
For performance and compatibility, use datetime + pytz.
???
...

The implementation is highly optimized.  

The feature set is somewhat sparse; you'll almost certainly need additional
packages to fill feature gaps:

- Use pytz for time zones; though be careful to use the API correctly.
- Use udatetime to accelerate some operations, most notably string parsing.
- Use Babel and humanize if you need them for UIs.

---
class: advice, middle
For large datasets involving times and dates, use Pandas.
???
...

NumPy can store these values, but provides almost no operations.  If you already
use NumPy and don't need time operations, it may be adequate.

Otherwise, go with Pandas.

class: advice, middle
Learn how to use datetime, even if it's not your primary representation.

It's the _lingua franca_ for times and dates in Python.

class: advice

# General advice

- Don't use `str` or `int` for times or dates.  Use real types.
- Don't use time types for dates.
- Avoid naive `datetime` instances; carry a time zone.
- Use UTC internall wherever possible.
- Use ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 formats wherever possible.
- Make sure your time zone database is up-to-date.

Do we need another datetime library?

???
No!

But that never stopped anyone...

# Ora

[http://github.com/alexhsamuel/ora](http://github.com/alexhsamuel/ora)

- very high performance
- multiple widths and precisions
- simplified API
- time zones built in

Pre-release quality!  But try it out.

```py
>>> t = now()
>>> print(t)
2018-03-02T23:19:17.62649500+00:00
>>> date, daytime = t @ "America/New_York"
>>> date
Date(2018, Mar, 2)
```

???
Ora is a time and date library I've been developing as a side project for
some years.  It started as a curiosity project and grew into a fairly
extensive library.

All the logic is in C++, and it's very fast, as fast or faster than any of the
other libraries.

It supports multiple widths and precisions.  You want a 128-bit time type with
sub-nanosecond support over a 10,000 year range?  We got it.

The API is centered around physical times, and converted to components only for
formatting.

The time zone database and lots of other features are built in, with no
dependencies.

If none of the other libraries meet your needs, give it a shot, and drop me a
line.
